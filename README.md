## Enhancement Patterns

| Base Solution | Enhancement | Example Application |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| OAuth2.1/RAR + DPoP (High Risk User) | Add revocation endpoint, session binding, logging | Banking app with instant token revocation and session monitoring |
| OAuth2.1 RAR + DPoP (High Risk Backend) | Add anomaly detection, user re-consent | Investment platform detecting unusual trading patterns |
| SPIFFE + ZCAPs (High Risk Org) | Policy engine + dynamic authorization | Healthcare system with dynamic access control based on patient context |
| SPIFFE + ZCAPs chain (High Risk Agents) | Delegation expiration, capability revocation | Autonomous vehicle fleet with time-limited agent interactions |

## Key Terms

- **OAuth2.1/RAR**: Rich Authorization Requests for fine-grained permissions
- **DPoP**: Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession to bind tokens to clients
- **SPIFFE**: Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone
- **ZCAPs**: Authorization Capabilities for delegation chains
- **Macaroons**: Bearer tokens with embedded caveats for attenuation
- **UMA 2.0**: User-Managed Access for user-controlled authorization
- **Phantom Token**: Opaque reference token that hides actual JWT from client

## Decision Tree Structure

### Layer 1: Primary Service Model
- **Serves a user**: Agent acts on behalf of individual users
- **Serves the organization / itself**: Agent operates for organizational needs or autonomous operations
- **Serves other agents / multi-agent collaboration**: Agent participates in multi-agent systems
- **Delegates between users**: Agent facilitates user-to-user interactions with proper consent

### Layer 2: Runtime Environment Categories

#### For User-Serving Agents:
- **Runs in browser or edge**: Client-side execution, limited trust environment
- **Runs on backend / cloud / internal**: Server-side execution, controlled environment

#### For Organization-Serving Agents:
- **Kubernetes / microservice infra**: Container orchestration, service mesh environments
- **Cloud VM / serverless**: Virtual machines or serverless computing platforms
- **Edge or public-facing**: Deployed at network edge or public interfaces

#### For Multi-Agent Systems:
- **Internal agent network**: Agents within same trust domain
- **Cross-domain or federated**: Agents across different trust boundaries

#### For User Delegation:
- **User-to-user sharing with consent**: Facilitating controlled sharing between users

### Layer 3: Risk Assessment
Each environment path branches into three risk levels:
- **Low Risk**: Basic security requirements, standard threat model
- **Medium Risk**: Elevated security needs, additional protections required
- **High Risk**: Critical security requirements, comprehensive protection needed
